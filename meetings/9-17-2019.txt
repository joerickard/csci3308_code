Features:
Users <-> files
Two databases, one for the users and the ids to their files, other is where the files are 
stores and the ids would correlate to the database with the files
So that way we are searching for the id rather than the file
Authentication database, person comes in and authenticates, go through user ids and see if the user has access to the files
Store Database where we will take the file id and pull the file
