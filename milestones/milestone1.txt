Application Name: Simple Store
Application Description: Simple Store will allow groups of users to share documents between them. User accounts will be able to upload documents, and then choose which other users, if any, will also be able to see and/or edit the documents. This will be accomplished through either a well featured CLI, or a browser based UI, both leveraging HTTP requests to interact with the file store. 
Vision: For students who need to share files between their colleagues. The Simple Store is a cloud based storage system that allows users to upload their files to AWS and access them anywhere. Unlike Google Drive our product is for the simple mind, we don’t have a bogged down UI, in fact, we don’t have one at all.
Version Control:
https://github.com/joerickard/csci3308 (folder that contains the three repositories)
Development Method:
Communication Plan:
We will be using Slack to communicate, and in person meetings on Tuesdays at 5-7pm. Through Slack we will share research information, and links to resources that aid us in development. We have two channels, one for front-end and one for back-end, and a general channel for any conversation that the whole team should be in the loop on. In person, we will be able to work as a team to answer problems that arise.
Meeting Plan: 
We will be meeting Tuesdays at 5pm, scheduling through Slack and we will be reserving different rooms (depending on availability) to meet in person.
